## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-problem-solver.git
cd math-problem-solver
2. Install dependencies
💡 Use a virtual environment if possible.

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set up .env file
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys:

env
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_key_here
🎮 Usage
Run the program:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
You will be prompted to input your math problem by:

Typing it

Speaking it

Uploading an image

The AI will return a clear, step-by-step solution.

🧪 Dependencies
Your requirements.txt should include:

txt
Copy
Edit
openai
deepgram-sdk
pyaudio
Pillow
python-dotenv
keyboard
⚠️ On Windows, you may need to install pyaudio manually via a .whl file if the regular install fails.

🤖 AI Prompt Format
The assistant follows the Thetawise format:

A short explanation of the problem

Step-by-step breakdown in plain English

A clear final answer (e.g., “So, the solution is x = 5”)

🛑 Limitations
Only supports .jpg, .jpeg, and .png for image input

Voice input ends when you press Enter

Requires internet access for OpenAI & Deepgram APIs

🧩 Future Improvements
GUI using Gradio or Tkinter

Error logging and retry system

Optional LaTeX output support
